## Packages

We will explore the "stringr" package of the tidyverse.  In this tutorial we will examine the following things:

1) Basics
2) Text Manipulation
3) Regular Expressions
4) Repetition
5) Grouped Matches

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```

## Part 1: Stringr basics

## How to create a string
Strings are created using either single or double quotes. You can use either. 

```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'This is a string too'
```

## Task 1: Correct the following code. What is wrong?

```{r}
string3 <- 'Yesterday I arrived to "BER" airport in Berlin'
string3b <- 'Yesterday I arrived to 'BER' airport in Berlin'




```

## Part 2: Manipulating text with stringr
All functions from the stringr family begin with the str_

One of the most used functions in base R is the `paste()` function, which can be used to merge multiple text elements into one. For strings it is useful to use `str_c()`(see later).

```{r}
text1 <- "lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry"
text2 <- "lorem ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book"
text3 <- "it has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged"

full_text <- paste(text1, text2, text3)
full_text
```

We can subset strings using the `str_sub()` function. Use numbers to designate which characters you’d like to extract.

```{r str_sub() function}
str_sub(full_text, 1, 11)
```

## Task 2: Can you think of a way to extract the last word of the string by using this method?

```{r str_sub() function}


```

We have functions `str_to_upper()` and `str_to_lower()` for changing the case of our strings. Let's see an example with `str_to_upper()`:

```{r str_to_upper() function}
str_to_upper(full_text)
```

## Now let's do some formatting
In our text, there are no seperators (.) between the strings. Additionally, no capital letters at the start of a sentence. The text also does not end with a period.

We can use stringr in order to specify how strings should be merged.
```{r str_to_c() function}
#Seperators & space:
full_text <- str_c(text1, text2, text3,  sep = ". ")
full_text
```

We will add a period at the very end of the string when we learn regular expressions later on.

Now, we still have no capital letters. 

## Does subsetting help?
Yes, with subsetting one can select certain elements in a string that need to be altered.

## Use str_sub and str_to_upper to alter object text1
```{r Subsetting using str_to_upper() function}

str_sub(text1, 1, 1) <- str_to_upper(str_sub(text1, 1, 1))
``````

## Part 3: Regular expressions (regex)
Ideally, we combine stringr with regex! The real power of stringr lies in the ability of the package to deal with regular expressions. Regex is useful for more complex changes. 

Some regex examples:

* `\d`: matches any digit
* `\s`: matches any whitespace
* `[abc]`: matches a, or b, or c
* `[^abc]`: matches anything except a, or b, or c
* `[ab|c]`: matches ab together, or c

Everything is in the cheatsheet: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf

```{r}

#Change first letter to uppercase using regex
str_view_all(full_text, "(^[[:alpha:]])")

text2 <- gsub("(^[[:alpha:]])", "\\U\\1", text2, perl=TRUE)
text3 <- gsub("(^[[:alpha:]])", "\\U\\1", text3, perl=TRUE)

#\\U, in conjunction with perl=TRUE, says 'put what follows in upper case'
#\\1 in the replacement string says 'insert the contents of the first #matched pattern'

full_text <- str_c(text1, text2, text3,  sep = ". ")
full_text

#End text with dot:
str_view_all(full_text, "$")
full_text <- gsub("$", "\\.", full_text, perl=TRUE)
full_text
``````

## Example of dataframe
Vector with 980 random words (a-z).
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word = words)

#Return number of words that start with "y"
sum(str_count(df$word, "^y"))
``````

## Task 3: Generate a table which shows the number of vowels, consonants and words containing a_or_c using regex. Hint: Look at regex examples.

```{r Use str_count() to get regular expression matches}



``````

## Part 4: Repetition
You can specify the number of matches precisely using the following expressions:

{n}: exactly n
{n,}: n or more
{,m}: at most m
{n,m}: between n and m

```{r }
x <- "My favourite website is goooooogle.com"

str_view(x, "o{2}")
str_view(x, "o{2,}")
str_view(x, "o{2,3}")
``````

## Task 4: Extract the phone-numbers from the follwing string and store it into a new vector by using the function `str_subset()`. The format is +X XXX XXX XXX/X.
```{r}





``````

```{r}
#you can also store a regex as an object using regex().

regex1 <- regex("\\+\\d{1}\\ \\d{3}\\ \\d{3}\\ \\d{3,4}")

str_view(phones_raw, regex1)

``````

## Part 5: Grouped matches
We can use parentheses to extract parts of a complex match. For example,  we want to extract nouns from the sentences, so lets look for any word that comes after “a” or “the”. Defining a “word” in a regular expression is a little tricky, an approximation would be a sequence of at least one character that isn’t a space.

```{r}
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"

has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun %>% 
  str_extract(noun)

#str_extract() gives us the complete match

has_noun %>% 
  str_match(noun)

#str_match() gives each individual component

``````

## Task 5: Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word. 

```{r}



`````
