# String Manipulation with Stringr
Tutorial on R Package "stringr" by Richard Garcia-Guerrero &amp; Adrian Werner

## Summary

This repository provides materials to learn how to manipulate strings in R using the "stringr" package. It includes a presentation in PowerPoint format providing an overview of "stringr", as well as an R Markdown (RMD) file containing basic exercises to practice using "stringr" functions.

It is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session is divided into two parts: the presentation and the tutorial.

#### Presentation (PPT format)

The presentation introduces the participant to string, its uses, and its prevalence in R workflow. Then, it introduces the "stringr" package, describing its functionalities across various categories.

The presentation concludes with a brief overview of regular expressions, and its role in "stringr" commands. 

#### Tutorial (RMD format)

The tutorial provides an opportunity for the participant to familiarize themselves with basic "stringr" functions, as well as regular expressions to supplement their use of "stringr" functionalities.

### Main learning objectives

Upon completion, participants will understand what a string is, its use in R workflow, and how to use the "stringr" package to:

- detect matches,
- mutate strings,
- subset strings,
- join and split strings,
- manage the length of strings,
- sort and order strengths,
- and more.
